# Seminar

There are 9 time slots until the end the term. So, please prepare a 30 minute lecture on a paper of interest. This contents of the paper should be aligned with the general topics areas of this course. We encourage you to also choose a topic in the general area of your PhD research. When in doubt please reach out.
