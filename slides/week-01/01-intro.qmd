## Definition of Digital Twin {.smaller}

Definition from [@asch2022toolbox]: "*A set of virtual information constructs that mimics the structure, context, and behavior of an individual/unique physical asset, or a group of physical assets, is dynamically updated with data from its physical twin throughout its life cycle and informs decisions that realize value.*"

-   Definition by the Aerospace Industries Association
-   Mirroring physical assets in a dynamic manner

Definition by [IBM](https://www.ibm.com/topics/what-is-a-digital-twin): "*A digital twin is a virtual representation of an object or system that spans its lifecycle, is updated from real-time data, and uses simulation, machine learning and reasoning to help decision making.*"

## Definition of Digital Twin (cont'ed)  {.smaller}

Definition from [@national2023foundational]: "*A digital twin is a set of virtual information constructs that mimics the structure, context, and behavior of a natural, engineered, or social system (or system-of-systems), is dynamically updated with data from its physical twin, has a predictive capability, and informs decisions that realize value. The bidirectional interaction between the virtual and the physical is central to the digital twin.*"

Also see discussion [Section 2 of "A comprehensive review of digital twin ‚Äî part 1"](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00158-022-03425-4).

## Data flows {.smaller}

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="60%"}

- For a digital model, data flow between the physical space and virtual space is optional

- For a digital shadow, data flow is unidirectional from physical to digital. 

- But for digital twin, the data flow has to be bidirectional. See Figure.

$$\mathrm{DT} = \mathbb{F} (\mathrm{PS, DS, P2V, V2P, OPT})$$

five- dimensional digital twin model consists of 

- a physical system (PS),

-  a digital system (DS), 

-  an updating engine (P2V), 

-  a prediction engine (V2P), 

-  and an optimization dimension (OPT).
 
$\mathbb{F}(‚ãÖ)$ integrates all five dimensions together to define a **Digital Twin**.

## The Concept of a Digital Twin {.smaller}

- the availability of (large) volumes of (often real-time) data, 

-  the accessibility to this data,
  
- the tools and implementations of AI-based algorithms,
  
- the body of knowledge of mathematical models,
  
- the readiness and low cost of computational devices,

Necessary ingredients for a Digital Twin that learns during its life cycle

- consists of *static* part --- initial model, design, and

- *dynamic* part --- includes the simulation process, coupled with data acquisition, and finally autoupdating.

## Geological Carbon Storage{.smaller}

- wave physics

## Models, Data, and Coupling in Digital Twins{.smaller}

Questions:

1. What is meant by a ‚Äúmodel‚Äù?
   
2. What are data to be used for?
   
3. How, if possible, can we couple the above two to construct the most informative DT?
   
Will be discussing two types of models throughout the book:

1. Equation-based models that are derived, most often, from some conservation laws.
2. Statistical, data-driven models that are based on measured data and its analysis.

**A good statistical model:** should attain a good balance between under/overfitting. 

**Physical models:** need to capture the higher order terms and neglect small terms.

Bloated models will often be difficult to solve numerically.

## Recommended Approach---The Triple-Loop Method{.smaller}

Three loops: Space and time, optimization, decision-making

- Loops over space and time and solution of the physical problem in the inner loop.
  
-  Optimization in the outer loop, including control, solution of an inverse problem, parameter estimation, uncertainty quantification, and multifidelity modeling using surrogates.

- Decision making in the outer-outer loop--- preventative maintenance, shutting down operations ...
 
Important to ensure trustworthiness of the DT
 - checking operational and validity regimes of the model, and 
 - implement an expert system based on engineering experience.

<!-- ## Recommendations for Project Managers

-   Developing in-house vs purchasing
-   Intellectual property, model brittleness, uncertainty quantification -->
