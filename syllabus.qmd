## Lectures & computational labs

In part the course is an adaptation of open-source Basic and Advanced courses ([CSU-IMU-2023](https://github.com/markasch/CSU-IMU-2023)) developed by [Mark Asch](https://markasch.github.io/DT-tbx-v1/). [Codes](https://markasch.github.io/DT-tbx-v1/codes/) will be drawn from the course and from the book. During the second half of the course, we will draw from the current literature.

## Course community

### Inclusive community

It is my intent that students from all diverse backgrounds and perspectives be well-served by this course, that students' learning needs be addressed both in and out of class, and that the diversity that the students bring to this class be viewed as a resource, strength, and benefit. It is my intent to present materials and activities that are respectful of diversity and in alignment with [Georgia Tech's Commitment to Diversity and Inclusion](https://catalog.gatech.edu/policies/diversity/). Your suggestions are encouraged and appreciated.

### Discrimination, Harassment, and Sexual Misconduct

To maintain a safe learning environment that fosters the dignity, respect, and success of students, faculty, and staff, Tech prohibits discriminatory harassment, which is unwelcome verbal, nonverbal, or physical conduct directed at any person or group based upon race, color, religion, sex, national origin, age, disability, sexual orientation, gender identity, or veteran status that has the purpose or effect of creating an objectively hostile working or academic environment.

## Course policies

### Academic honesty

Please abide by the following as you work on assignments in this course:

-   You may discuss individual lab assignments with other students; however, you may not directly share (or copy) code or write up with other students. For team assignments, you may collaborate freely within your team. You may discuss the assignment with other teams; however, you may not directly share (or copy) code or write up with another team. Unauthorized sharing (or copying) of the code or write up will be considered a violation for all students involved.
-   **Reusing code**: Unless explicitly stated otherwise, you may make use of online resources (e.g. StackOverflow) for coding examples on assignments. If you directly use code from an outside source (or use it as inspiration), you must explicitly cite where you obtained the code. Any recycled code that is discovered and is not explicitly cited will be treated as plagiarism.

### Guidance on the use of Generative AI

AI-based assistance, such as ChatGPT and Copilot, can be used in the same way as collaboration with other people for the following activities: For lab assignments in understanding the lecture and textbook materials, and in developing your ideals for the project proposals. In these activities you are welcome to talk about your ideas and work with other people, both inside and outside the class, as well as with AI- based assistants. In the course, we will discuss how you can use these tools as a study tool, or as an assistant in helping to draft code or summaries.

#### Generating Research Ideas or Approaches:

-   Brainstorming: You can use the AI tool as a brainstorming partner, where you exchange ideas whether the AI prompts you or you prompt the AI for ideas. Brainstorming is an iterative process that can be made more effective with the way that the queries are posted. For more samples or information, post this query: “How can I use AI to help me to brainstorm an idea?”

-   Surveying Existing Approaches: Large Language Models, if trained broadly in a topic, can give a good initial overview of existing approaches or existing literature on a topic. Current research sources such as library or professional society databases are more reliable in terms of accuracy of peer-reviewed content.

-   Prompt engineering is important: Practice the prompts used for Generative AI. The value of the response depends on the value of the prompt. If you provide a low quality or vague prompt, you will get vague results. Varying skill levels among users might exacerbate existing inequalities among students. For example, students for whom English is the second language might be at a disadvantage.

#### Advice on Usage:

-   Be very skeptical of the results. Do not trust any outputs that you cannot evaluate yourself or trace back to original credible sources. There are many stories of generative AI giving citations of articles that do not exist (see the article in the Chronicles of Higher Education referenced below).

-   Be scientific with your prompts (or queries): Prompting is not deterministic, so the same prompt at a different time may result in a different response. Small changes in the wording of the prompt may yield very different responses. Keep records, make small changes and see how it affects the outcome, etc.

-   Don’t share any data or information that is confidential, proprietary, or have IP implications. Your uploaded data or ideas might be incorporated into the learning model to be available for others in your research area, prior to you having a chance to publish it. If you intend to pursue commercialization or other Intellectual Property avenues for your work, putting the information into an open AI platform may be considered as disclosure.

### Late work & extensions

The due dates for assignments are there to help you keep up with the course material and to ensure the teaching team can provide feedback within a timely manner. We understand that things come up periodically that could make it difficult to submit an assignment by the deadline. Note that the lowest lab assignments will be dropped to accommodate such circumstances.

### Campus Resources for Students

#### Additional services offered by Satellite counselors' (walk-in consultation hours):

Each Satellite counselor provides weekly consultation appointments at varying times based on their schedules (see highlighted section below for my Fall '23 hours). Anyone can access a Satellite counselor during these times, to set up a consultation email is preferable, once a message is received the Satellite counselor will reply with available dates/times and a link. Some Satellite counselors will accommodate in-person walk-ins at these times as well.

##### What it is

-   Consulting about a brief, non-emergency concern during the counselor's posted walk-in consultation hours (similar to Let's Talk). Consultations are approximately 15 minutes.
-   Providing information to students about mental health resources on campus and how to get connected
-   Consulting with faculty/staff about a student of concern

##### What it isn't

-   Not for a walk-in counseling appointment or initial assessment
-   Not for students who are seeking support in their counselor's absence. Students who need additional/urgent support when their counselor is unavailable should visit the Center for Mental Health Care & Resources
-   Not for crisis
-   Not for case management
