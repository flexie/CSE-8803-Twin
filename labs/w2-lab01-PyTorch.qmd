Read over (or run if you need practice) notebooks 1-Basics. Run all of notebook 2-NN basics and workflows. Rerun notebook 2 and make the task a bit more difficult by:

- adding Gaussian standard noise to the data. (w/ at least sigma=0.01)

- adjust training hyperparameters as necessary to achieve good results.

For extra credit run notebook 3. If you do not have access to a GPU, use free tier Google collab GPU with instructions outlined in [https://flexie.github.io/CSE-8803-Twin/schedule.html](https://flexie.github.io/CSE-8803-Twin/schedule.html).
