## Weekly schedule

::: {#schedule}
:::

### Labs

Labs will be due on Fridays at 11:59pm. 

### Lab software installation instructions

Labs can be rerun in the language of your choice (Julia/R) but if you chose to reuse the Python code then you can easily run on Google Collab. This service includes a free tier that only requires a Google account. For future projects that require intensive matrix multiplication operations such as convolutional networks a hardware accelerator will drastically improve execution time. These are accessible in Collab by restarting the notebook after: Runtime -> Change runtime type ->  Hardware accelerator = T4 GPU (in free tier).

### Lab submission instructions

To submit assignments please export your notebook as PDF and send to TA's Gatech email: [Rafael Orozco](mailto:rorozco@gatech.edu) with subject line that includes the phrase "CSE-8803 Lab [# of lab]". To export notebook as PDF in Google collab: File -> Print -> Set Destination to "save as PDF" -> Save.
