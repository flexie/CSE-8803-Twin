    "text": "Course policies\n\nAcademic honesty\nPlease abide by the following as you work on assignments in this course:\n\nYou may discuss individual lab assignments with other students; however, you may not directly share (or copy) code or write up with other students. For team assignments, you may collaborate freely within your team. You may discuss the assignment with other teams; however, you may not directly share (or copy) code or write up with another team. Unauthorized sharing (or copying) of the code or write up will be considered a violation for all students involved.\nReusing code: Unless explicitly stated otherwise, you may make use of online resources (e.g. StackOverflow) for coding examples on assignments. If you directly use code from an outside source (or use it as inspiration), you must explicitly cite where you obtained the code. Any recycled code that is discovered and is not explicitly cited will be treated as plagiarism.\n\n\n\nGuidance on the use of Generative AI\nAI-based assistance, such as ChatGPT and Copilot, can be used in the same way as collaboration with other people for the following activities: For lab assignments in understanding the lecture and textbook materials, and in developing your ideals for the project proposals. In these activities you are welcome to talk about your ideas and work with other people, both inside and outside the class, as well as with AI- based assistants. In the course, we will discuss how you can use these tools as a study tool, or as an assistant in helping to draft code or summaries.\n\nGenerating Research Ideas or Approaches:\n\nBrainstorming: You can use the AI tool as a brainstorming partner, where you exchange ideas whether the AI prompts you or you prompt the AI for ideas. Brainstorming is an iterative process that can be made more effective with the way that the queries are posted. For more samples or information, post this query: “How can I use AI to help me to brainstorm an idea?”\nSurveying Existing Approaches: Large Language Models, if trained broadly in a topic, can give a good initial overview of existing approaches or existing literature on a topic. Current research sources such as library or professional society databases are more reliable in terms of accuracy of peer-reviewed content.\nPrompt engineering is important: Practice the prompts used for Generative AI. The value of the response depends on the value of the prompt. If you provide a low quality or vague prompt, you will get vague results. Varying skill levels among users might exacerbate existing inequalities among students. For example, students for whom English is the second language might be at a disadvantage.\n\n\n\nAdvice on Usage:\n\nBe very skeptical of the results. Do not trust any outputs that you cannot evaluate yourself or trace back to original credible sources. There are many stories of generative AI giving citations of articles that do not exist (see the article in the Chronicles of Higher Education referenced below).\nBe scientific with your prompts (or queries): Prompting is not deterministic, so the same prompt at a different time may result in a different response. Small changes in the wording of the prompt may yield very different responses. Keep records, make small changes and see how it affects the outcome, etc.\nDon’t share any data or information that is confidential, proprietary, or have IP implications. Your uploaded data or ideas might be incorporated into the learning model to be available for others in your research area, prior to you having a chance to publish it. If you intend to pursue commercialization or other Intellectual Property avenues for your work, putting the information into an open AI platform may be considered as disclosure.\n\n\n\n\nLate work & extensions\nThe due dates for assignments are there to help you keep up with the course material and to ensure the teaching team can provide feedback within a timely manner. We understand that things come up periodically that could make it difficult to submit an assignment by the deadline. Note that the lowest lab assignments will be dropped to accommodate such circumstances.\n\n\nCampus Resources for Students\nLinks to Campus Resources for Students — e.g. Center for Academic Success, Communication Center, Office of Disability Services, OMED, Division of Student Life, etc. available at: https://ctl.gatech.edu/sites/default/files/documents/campus_resources_students.pdf\n\nQuick Guide on Student Mental Health and Wellness Resources:\nThe Center for Mental Health Care & Resources is here to offer confidential support and services to students in need of mental health care. During regular business hours, students who are not actively in counseling may call 404-894-2575 or walk-in to the office , 353 Ferst DR NW Atlanta GA 30313 (Flag building next to the Student Center). Any time outside of business hours, students may call 404-894-2575 and select the option to speak to the after-hours counselor.\n\n\nAdditional On Campus Options\nStudents who are experiencing an immediate life-threatening emergency on campus, can call the Georgia Tech Campus Police at 404-894-2500\n\n\nLocal and National crisis resources available 24/7:\n\nCrisis Text Line: Text HOME to 741741 https://www.crisistextline.org/\nGeorgia Crisis & Access Line: Call 1-800-715-4225\nNational Suicide Prevention Lifeline: Call 988 or 1-800-273-8255, or access text chat here https://suicidepreventionlifeline.org/chat/\n\n\n\nAdditional services offered by Satellite counselors’ (walk-in consultation hours):\nEach Satellite counselor provides weekly consultation appointments at varying times based on their schedules (see highlighted section below for my Fall ’23 hours). Anyone can access a Satellite counselor during these times, to set up a consultation email is preferable, once a message is received the Satellite counselor will reply with available dates/times and a link. Some Satellite counselors will accommodate in-person walk-ins at these times as well.\n\nWhat it is\n\nConsulting about a brief, non-emergency concern during the counselor’s posted walk-in consultation hours (similar to Let’s Talk). Consultations are approximately 15 minutes.\nProviding information to students about mental health resources on campus and how to get connected\nConsulting with faculty/staff about a student of concern\n\n\n\nWhat it isn’t\n\nNot for a walk-in counseling appointment or initial assessment\nNot for students who are seeking support in their counselor’s absence. Students who need additional/urgent support when their counselor is unavailable should visit the Center for Mental Health Care & Resources\nNot for crisis\nNot for case management\n\nTara Holdampf, MS, LPC, (she/her), Satellite Counselor’s Consultation Hours for the College of Sciences: Please email tara.holdampf@studentlife.gatech.edu for an appointment, or stop by my Office Location: MoSE 1120B.
